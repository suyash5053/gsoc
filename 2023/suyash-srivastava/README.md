Hello Everyone,

I'm Suyash Srivastava, a 2nd Year BSC Hons CS student from Lucknow,India. I'm greateful to the mentor and all the members of this board for giving me this chance to introduce myself. I have started my contribution and open source journey by contribution in OWASP and then I started contributing in wagtail. Wagtail is one of the large codebases that I have known, and its not easy enough to learn and go through it but if you have done it woah, you have already passed the tough part. I have contributed in Wagtail from last 2 months and I'm happy that my PR's were merged several times. 

I would appreaciate any help given by the mentors and fellow members to me.

Thank you.
